# GIF Explorer

**GIF Explorer** consists of two services:

* **Frontend**: A ReactJS application built and bundled with Vite for near-instant server start, ES module support, and hot reload.
* **Backend**: A NestJS REST API that proxies requests to an external GIF provider, it implements error handling and caching, and returns a consistent JSON payload.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Docker 20.10+ and Docker Compose
* Node.js 18+ (optional for local dev without Docker)

### Run with Docker

0. add your Giphy api key:

    go to **apps/giphy-service** add a **.env** file with:

   ```GIPHY_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>```
    
1. build & Start all services:
    
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
3. Access the app in your browser: [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80)

### Run Locally (no Docker)

1. **Backend**

   ```bash
   cd giphy-service
   npm install
   # Create a .env file with:
   # GIPHY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here for example 
   npm run start
   ```
2. **Frontend**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Configuration

Environment variables are loaded from two files:

* **giphy-service/.env** (runtime):

  ```env
  GIPHY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```
* **frontend/.env** (build time):

  ```env
  VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
  ```

## Areas for Improvement

* **Frontend Unit Tests**: We currently lack automated tests for React components. Adding Jest and React Testing Library tests will increase confidence during refactoring.
* **Documentation**: Expand code comments and architectural diagrams to meet internal standards and simplify onboarding.

* **Rate limiting & retries (API)**: If we intend to make this app scalable we should protect & stabilize our expensive Giphy API endpoint with Add rate limiting (`@nestjs/throttler`) and exponential-back-off retries with a circuit breaker.

* **Cache store**: In memory cache is the simplest choice for our 1 instance backend, if we intend to make use of horizental scalability by using more instances , we should use a better caching service that instance independant (like redis)

* **Security headers / CORS**: Should white list our frontend services only. 
* **CI/CD pipeline**: We should add a CI/CD pipelin (lint , test, build/push) .
* **E2Es**: Add e2es to front & back
